October means halloween! For your spooky reading pleasure the blog now has a dark mode. Dim the lights, pull up a ocmfy chair and we can begin.

In September we posted our [Series A funding announcement](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-09-26-announcing-gatsby-15m-series-a-funding-round/), then headed to the UK for Gatsby Days London. Fear not, if you missed all the action you can [catch up by watching the videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvO7h_KwgpE&list=PLCU2qJekvcN2f9rgS50xy7-4QBpgwid4G).

## Team highlights

On with some features and updates from the team.

First up is something we're calling _structured logging_. We've done some behind the scenes re-working of Gatsby's logging code. Gatsby now keeps an internal list of messages, and can output those messages in different formats. As an example, run `gatsby build --json` to see the your build logs output as JSON instead of the more usual log messages.

In future this will enable things like a Gatsby desktop app. [Have a nose at the PR to see what went into this release](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/14973). As a result of this work there are have been a few fixes and enhancements to the standard CLI output.

### Is Gatsby translated yet?

Following on [from an RFC](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/rfcs/pull/42) in September, there are now 10 in-progress translations for Gatsby's documentation. Want to get involved? Check out [the new Gatsby Docs Translation Guide](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/gatsby-docs-translation-guide/). Thanks to Nat Alison (twitter url here) for driving this project!

### Overview of the Gatsby Build Process

Have you ever wondered what Gatsby _does_ when you run a build? Now there's a new docs page that runs through the details. [Overview of the Gatsby Build Process](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/overview-of-the-gatsby-build-process/) is the place to go. I particularly like [the diagram that explains the different layers of Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/overview-of-the-gatsby-build-process/#what-happens-when-you-run-gatsby-build).

### Schema Customization Examples

We're gradually moving official plugins over to use the schema customisation APIs added earlier this year. See [the changes to `gatsby-transformer-sharp` for an example](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/18871). If you're interested in getting started with this, there's a little-known plugin that will write out the schema for your inferred data. See https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-schema-snapshot/

### Offline plugin

The [offline plugin has been updated to handle more edge cases](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/17590). Now the plugin will revert back to the network if a visitor disables JavaScript after the site has already been cached. Thanks to @davidbailey00.

### .org Dark Mode

Have you tried out the superbly stylish dark mode for gatsbyjs.org? Hit the "Activate dark mode" button in the site header to see it in action. You can see the [first PR for this](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/18348), along with a series of [follow up PRs to iron out the kinks](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pulls?q=is%3Apr+dark+mode+is%3Aclosed).

### Grab Bag

There are a few more bits and bobs that are also worth mentioning.

Have you been working with Gatsby themes? Under the hood, a theme and a plugin are pretty similar. Until recently, creating a local theme in your `plugins` directory would have caused an error. A recent update fixes this, making the `plugins` directory work for local themes. Maybe you could use this for prototyping or one-off themes. See [PR #15856 for the full lowdown](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/15856).

A persistent bug that was first reported back in 2017 [has been squashed](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/19009). Good riddance :)

And finally this package. I can't improve on the description so I'm going to copy and paste it right here:

> Ever wanted a package that disables the mouse cursor one day a week so you can test keyboard accessibility as a team? No? Well here you go anyway.

Grab it from https://www.npmjs.com/package/no-mouse-days.

### Gatsby Days videos

If you missed Gatsby days don't worry, you can [watch the entire playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuyLCwAMCZo&list=PLCU2qJekvcN2f9rgS50xy7-4QBpgwid4G).

Follow that link to find a plethora of goodies including a keynote from Kyle Mathews, info on building and selling Gatsby themes by Horacio Herrera and advice on writing accessible components from Marcy Sutton.

### Your Pull Requests

There are too many to mention individually, but we can take a rocket powered tour through some highlights.

- Wide improvements to all Gatsby's documentation. Bringing docs in-line with the style guide proved to be a popular (and valuable) activity last month.
- [Improvements to how gatsby-plugin-offline handles custom link tags](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/16691) with the `rel=preconnect` attribute
- A [fix for the `wrapPageElement` API while running `gatsby develop`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/17111)
- [Performance improvements to querying](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/17682), adding a nice speed boost when building larger sites.
- By the same author [this PR improved Gatsby's type inference](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/18008), making it faster and less memory intensive.
- A [fix for `gatsby-plugin-manifest`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/17426) that ensures manifest links are updated after page navigation.
- An issue that happened when [creating a resolver using the `context.nodeModel` API was fixed](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/18650).
- [This PR](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/16686) reduces the number of files that are changed with each build. This should result in faster deploys on services like Netlify, particularly for larger sites.

## Site of the Month

The latest site of the month is [IBM's Carbon Design System](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/). What's it all about?

> Carbon is IBMâ€™s open-source design system for products and experiences. With the IBM Design Language as its foundation, the system consists of working code, design tools and resources, human interface guidelines, and a vibrant community of contributors.

Seems like everyone is building design systems these days - for good reason. There's a lot to like in here - based on guidelines to be open, inclusive, modular, user-based and consistent. Components are availble for vanilla JS, React, Angular, and Vue.

- Design system with lots of well thought out components and clear guidelines
- Open source
- Scale!

## Theme of the Month

![screenshot of gatsby-theme-firebase's readme](./gatsby-theme-firebase.png)

[`gatsby-theme-firebase`](https://github.com/epilande/gatsby-theme-firebase) might be the quickest way to add full-featured auth to your site, and it's our theme of the month for this month!

Add the theme, your Firebase credentials and off you go. Want to change anything? Use shadowing to override whichever components you want.
