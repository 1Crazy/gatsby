title: Building a Site with Authentication
---

Many sites require users to be authenticated in order to protect private data.

## Understanding authentication between client and server

In many modern websites, the [client](/docs/glossary#client-side) -- or [frontend](/docs/glossary#frontend) -- is [decoupled](/docs/glossary#decoupled) from the [backend](/docs/glossary#backend). This pattern is how Gatsby functions to combine data from a myriad of backend sources to facilitate building the frontend.

In order to provide authentication functionality, another service has to be leveraged and connected to Gatsby. Examples of these kinds of services could be open source technology like:

- A Node.js app using Passport.js
- A Ruby on Rails API using Devise

Or from a third party like:

- Firebase
- Auth0
- AWS Amplify
- Netlify Identity

The process of verifying a user on the client against an authentication service, and using a token returned by it to get protected data is visualized in this diagram:

![Diagram of Gatsby using an authentication service to get data from an API](./images/basic-auth.png)

1. First, a request is made from a Gatsby site (the client) to an authentication service to perform an action like register a new user or login.

2. If the credentials (like a username and password) provided from the client match a user in the authentication service, it returns a token (like a JSON Web Token, or JWT) so that the user has a key that they can use to prove they are who they say they are. The data returned about the user can be stored in the Gatsby app and passed to components using a Provider component with the React Context API using the [`wrapRootElement` API](/docs/browser-apis/#wrapRootElement) from Gatsby.

3. With the key, the client can make a request to an external data source like an API (the server) where protected data is stored, the key is unique to a specific user that allows them to access their specific data.

4. The server returns data back to the client that it can use on the client to pass information into components.

_**Note**: this is the same pattern that a site built with Create React App would need to follow._

## Implementing authentication in a Gatsby site

There are a few things to be aware of when implementing authentication in a Gatsby site, because of how Gatsby uniquely builds pages and renders static assets with dynamic capabilities.

### Setting up client-only routes

With Gatsby, you are able to create restricted areas in your app using [client-only routes](/docs/building-apps-with-gatsby/#client-only-routes).

As the [section from the Adding App and Website functionality](/docs/adding-app-and-website-functionality/#client-only-routes) overview page demonstrates, client-only routes can be created to route a user between pages using a React-based router, as opposed to navigating between different static HTML files on a server. Because static HTML files generated by Gatsby sit on a file server, you cannot programmatically control access to those files on the server from Gatsby (for example: a user could guess or type in a URL and navigate straight to the page).

Using the [`@reach/router` library](https://reach.tech/router/), which comes
installed with Gatsby, you can setup a router on a page and control which component will be loaded when a
certain route is called, and check for the authentication state before serving
the content.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
<Router>
  {isAuthenticated ? <PrivateRoute /> : <Login />}
</Router>
```

More specific code examples for this pattern are outlined in the [Client-only Routes & User Authentication guide](/docs/client-only-routes-and-user-authentication/#implementing-client-only-routes).

### Setting the authentication workflow

To create a common authentication workflow, you can usually follow these steps:

- [Create client-only routes](/tutorial/authentication-tutorial/#creating-client-only-routes),
  to tell Gatsby which routes should be rendered on demand
- [Wrap private content in a PrivateRoute component](/tutorial/authentication-tutorial/#controlling-private-routes),
  to check if a user is authenticated or not, therefore rendering the content or
  redirecting to another page (usually, the login page)

### Protecting code from accessing browser globals during build

Global objects that are accessible in the browser like `localStorage` aren't available while a Gatsby site is building, because the build runs in a Node.js environment. To keep the build process from breaking you may need to wrap places where

Some third party services might try and access the window object with internal methods, to protect against this those snippets of code should be wrapped in checks or `useEffect` hooks to verify that the code is running in the browser:

```javascript
import app from "firebase/app"

...

if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  app.initializeApp(config)
}
```

More information on build related errors is available in the guide on [debugging HTML builds](/docs/debugging-html-builds/).

## Real-world example: Gatsby store

The [Gatsby store](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/store.gatsbyjs.org) uses this
approach when handling a private route:

```jsx
// import ...
const PrivateRoute = ({ component: Component, ...rest }) => {
  if (
    !isAuthenticated() &&
    isBrowser &&
    window.location.pathname !== `/login`
  ) {
    // If weâ€™re not logged in, redirect to the home page.
    navigate(`/app/login`)
    return null
  }

  return (
    <Router>
      <Component {...rest} />
    </Router>
  )
}
```
