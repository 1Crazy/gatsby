title: Building a Site with Authentication
---

Many sites require users to be authenticated in order to protect private data.

## Understanding authentication between client and server

In many modern websites, the [client](/docs/glossary#client-side) -- or [frontend](/docs/glossary#frontend) -- is [decoupled](/docs/glossary#decoupled) from the [backend](/docs/glossary#backend). This pattern is how Gatsby functions to combine data from a myriad of backend sources to facilitate building the frontend. Create React App functions similarly in connecting to backend services but being deployed elsewhere.

In order to provide authentication functionality, another service has to leveraged and connected to Gatsby. Examples of these kinds of services could be open source technology like:

- A Node.js app using Passport.js
- A Ruby on Rails API using Devise

Or from a third party like:

- Firebase
- Auth0
- AWS Amplify
- Netlify Identity

The process of verifying a user on the client against an authentication service, and using a token returned by it to get protected data is visualized in this diagram:

![Diagram of Gatsby using an authentication service to get data from an API](./images/basic-auth.png)

1. First a request is made from a Gatsby site to an authentication service to perform an action like register a new user or login.

2. If the credentials (like a username and password) provided from Gatsby match a user in the authentication service, it returns a token (like a JSON Web Token, or JWT) so that the user has a key that they can use to prove they are who they say they are.

3. With the key, Gatsby can make a request to an external data source (like an API) where protected data is stored, the key is unique to a specific user that allows them to access they're specific data.

4. The API returns data back to Gatsby that it can use on the client to pass information into components.

## Making authentication possible with client-only routes

With Gatsby, you are able to create restricted areas in your app using [client-only routes](/docs/building-apps-with-gatsby/#client-only-routes).

<!-- include link to overview page diagram once PR is merged -->

As the section from the Adding App and Website functionality overview page shows, client-only routes can be created to route a user between pages using a React-based router, as opposed to navigating between different static HTML files on a server. Because static HTML files generated by Gatsby sit on a file server, you cannot programmatically control access to those files on the server from Gatsby (for example: a user could guess or type in a URL and navigate straight to the page).

Using the [@reach/router](https://reach.tech/router/) library, which comes
installed with Gatsby, you can control which component will be loaded when a
certain route is called, and check for the authentication state before serving
the content.

## Setting the authentication workflow

To create a common authentication workflow, you can usually follow these steps:

- [Create client-only routes](/tutorial/authentication-tutorial/#creating-client-only-routes),
  to tell Gatsby which routes should be rendered on demand
- [Wrap private content in a PrivateRoute component](/tutorial/authentication-tutorial/#controlling-private-routes),
  to check if a user is authenticated or not, therefore rendering the content or
  redirecting to another page (usually, the login page)

## Real-world example: Gatsby store

The [Gatsby store](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/store.gatsbyjs.org) uses this
approach when handling a private route:

```jsx
// import ...
const PrivateRoute = ({ component: Component, ...rest }) => {
  if (
    !isAuthenticated() &&
    isBrowser &&
    window.location.pathname !== `/login`
  ) {
    // If weâ€™re not logged in, redirect to the home page.
    navigate(`/app/login`)
    return null
  }

  return (
    <Router>
      <Component {...rest} />
    </Router>
  )
}
```
